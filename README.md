&emsp;Ray Tracing-Based Large-Scale MIMO Channel Simulator provides a deterministic and realistic channel modeling environment crucial for wireless communication studies. It constructs a comprehensive 3D virtual map from OpenStreetMap, integrating detailed representations of roads, buildings, and strategically deployed base stations (BSs) to ensure broad coverage. Mobility patterns of user equipment (UE), represented as vehicles, are realistically generated using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), which emulates traffic flow and vehicle behavior in urban environments. The integrated ray tracing module, Sionna RT, calculates accurate propagation paths between BSs and UEs, considering physical phenomena such as reflection, diffraction, and scattering. Configurable parameters in Sionna RT, including interaction types, antenna radiation patterns, and ray propagation depth, enable precise modeling of the MIMO-OFDM channel, providing detailed channel characteristics such as angles of arrival and departure, path coefficients, and delays.

## Virtual Environment Overview
* [Suwon](https://github.com/yongjun0711/Ray_tracing-based_large-scale_MIMO_channel_simulator/tree/main/scenario/Suwon)

<br/>

## Installation
We recommend that you run this simulator in a virtual environment using [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/).<br/><br/>

### _1. Prerequisite_
#### _1-1. Environmnet preparation for Sionna_
**GPU support (NVIDIA GPUs Only)**

If you would like to run the code on a GPU, be sure to complete the following steps

- **Update NVIDIA Drivers:** Install the most recent driver release that matches your GPU model.
- **Install GPU-Enabled TensorFlow:** Choose and install the TensorFlow build compiled with CUDA support.
- **Set Up CUDA & cuDNN:** Download and configure both CUDA and cuDNN librariesâ€”these are required for TensorFlow to offload operations onto the GPU.

You can refer to [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).<br/><br/>

**CPU support**

If you would like to run the code on a CPU, ensure [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) is installed on your system.<br/><br/>

#### _1-2. SUMO_
To run the mobility simulator, ensure [SUMO](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php) is installed on your system.<br/>

## Usage
You can create a customized MIMO-OFDM channel dataset by following the steps below.<br/><br/>

### _1. Set config.yaml_
We provide examples that operate at [7.8 GHz](https://github.com/yongjun0711/Ray_tracing-based_large-scale_MIMO_channel_simulator/blob/main/scenario/Suwon/simulation/7_8G/config.yaml) and [15.1 GHz](https://github.com/yongjun0711/Ray_tracing-based_large-scale_MIMO_channel_simulator/blob/main/scenario/Suwon/simulation/15_1G/config.yaml), respectively. By referring to the table below and modifying your `config.yaml`, you can design your simulator.
