&emsp;We model the propagation of EM waves considering all BSs in the defined virtual environment using Sionna RT, and characterize the path gain at each carrier frequency as shown in Coverage map at 7.8 GHz and Coverage map at 15.1 GHz. We can observe excellent coverage within the urban area, attributed to the high density of BSs, resulting in very few regions with low path gain. Conversely, areas located outside the central urban region exhibit relatively degraded coverage due to the lower density of BS deployments. Furthermore, peripheral regions without buildings or BSs exhibit minimal propagation, and these cells where no propagation are accordingly marked in gray. Based on this analysis, we demonstrate that the MIMO-OFDM channel dataset collected within this virtual environment is suitable for the various studies.
